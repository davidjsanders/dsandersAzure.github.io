If you haven't looked at Dialogflow (2) (was previously
API.ai) I can really recommend it. The screenshot above 
shows an example of using my hobby app (my CowBull 
microservice game) with Facebook messenger and natural 
language. I define the entities, intents, and actions
and RESTful microservices to handle them and Dialogflow
handles all the Natural Language elements. 

Check out the examples below of different number 
formats:

All for free! No coding or training (okay, I had to
define the intents, entities, etc.), but dialogflow
out of the box supported numerals and words. 
Truly amazing software and available for free at 
[dialogflow.com](https://dialogflow.com)
