Welcome to the new website. This is a first for me using two technologies I really like; Jekyll (1) and GitHub Pages (2). 
Jekyll is a static site generator and works hand-in-hand with GitHub pages to produce static sites. I'm still trying to figure
out my way around them both, but so far so good ;)
