**tl&dr : The new [website](www.davidjsanders.com) is live and built with GoDaddy's web builder** 

I love **simplicity**. As I begin the next stage of my 
career and look for a role that will take me to the
next stage of leadership and profile, I wanted to have
an easily accessible web presence that supported 
responsive design (it needs to look good across devices),
simple interface, and easy to maintain.

I short-listed three options:
* My [LinkedIn Profile](www.linkedin.com/in/dsanders-msc)
is publicly available and easy to use. My LinkedIn profile 
already exists and is kept up to date, so really there 
was nothing to do there.
* [Workfolio](www.workfolio.com) is a dedicated branding
site to increase professional visibility. Workfolio was 
interesting as I had an offer to use it for free for a 
period of six months but it's $12.75/mo after.
* Go Daddy's [Website Builder](https://ca.godaddy.com/websites/website-builder),
a tool to help build just about any site. Again, interesting
because the first month is free and then only $7.99/mo.

Cut a long story short, I went with GoDaddy. Telling it I 
wanted to do a resume based site and then letting it 
generate an outline saved a lot of time. Then it was just
a case of adding pages, sections, and content. All-in-all,
it was less than two days of effort for what (I think) was
a good site.

Let me know what you think.
