A solution that I've become really enamoured with is [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)Â which offers SaaS and on-premises tools for continuous integration.  What I really like is a simple YAML configuration controls the build pipeline on every commit.

**tl&dr : Use simple yaml configuration files with CircleCI.com to automatically prepare, pull, test, and deploy to Docker and Google App Engine.** 

Quick notes:
* The [yaml configuration file](https://github.com/dsandersAzure/python_cowbull_server/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml) is in my repository and publicly available.
* The CircleCI build will **not** complete if the Google Cloud app is disabled (a state I often use to save money).
* References and attributions are at the end of this post.

#### Step 1, Spin up the environment

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
build:
  docker:
    - image: circleci/python:3.6.1
    - image: redis
  working_directory: ~/python_cowbull_server
  environment:
    - REDIS_PORT: 6379
    - REDIS_HOST: localhost
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


This simple script stands up two Docker containers; the first provides the Python 3.6 runtime area, the second a Redis cache. The env. vars. simply tell my app where to find Redis.

#### Step 2, Restore the cache and install the dependencies

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
steps:
- checkout
- restore_cache:
    keys:
      - v2-dependencies-{{checksum "requirements.txt"}}
      - v2-dependencies-
  - run:
      name: install dependencies
      command: |
        python3 -m venv venv
        . venv/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

All that's happening here is we are restoring our environment dependencies cache (if it exists or defaulting if it doesn't) and then setting up a Python virtualenv and installing the project's requirements. We could easily add more virtual environments, e.g. for Python 2.7., simply by repeating these steps.

#### Step 3 Run the tests

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
- run:
    name: run tests
    command: |
      . venv/bin/activate
      set -o pipefail
      python -m unittest -v tests 2> >(tee -a /tmp/unittest-report.log >&2)
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

There's an interesting piece here. Notice that I've set pipefail to ensure that test failure is detected, and I've also redirected the error output to a file using process redirection with tee. There's a few reasons for this but I'd like to direct you back to the [original StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/692000/how-do-i-write-stderr-to-a-file-while-using-tee-with-a-pipe) that does clever stuff with process redirection and resolved my issues - it's worth reading.

#### Step 4 Install Google Cloud dependencies

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
- run:
    name: install Google Cloud dependencies
    command: |
      # Fix the repo to Jessie - needs to be updated later
      export CLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS=1
      export CLOUD_SDK_REPO="cloud-sdk-jessie"
      echo "deb http://packages.cloud.google.com/apt $CLOUD_SDK_REPO main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list
      curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
      sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk --yes
      echo $circlecibuilder | base64 --decode --ignore-garbage > auth.json
      gcloud auth activate-service-account $circleciuser --key-file auth.json --project=$gproject
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This section basically downloads and installs the Google gcloud environment and uses env. vars. (defined in the CircleCI console) to provide the credentials to a minimum privileged service account that is able to deploy to Google App Engine.

The steps for this were heavily influenced by a really good [Atlassian](www.atlassian.com) article on [deploying to Google](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/deploy-to-google-cloud-900820342.html) using BitBucket pipelines. I borrowed these steps for a CircleCI approach.

One final note, the project is set in an env. var. so it can be easily changed.

#### Step 5 Build the GAE environment and deploy

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
   - run:
     name: Build GAE project and deploy
     command: |
       export CLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS=1
       mkdir -p vendor/gae
       pip install -t vendor/gae/lib -r requirements.txt
       gcloud app deploy --version="cigen-"$MAJOR_VERSION"-"$MINOR_VERSION"-"$CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM --quiet
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Here, I've disabled prompts and then created a vendor structure for my GAE project to contain a library of my python packages required to run the app. *Notice* that the path isn't in the repo because I don't want a whole host of Python libs in my git repository.

When the requirements have been installed I don't re-run the unit tests (because they've already passed) and I then app deploy setting the version name to MAJOR-MINOR-BUILD_NUM. I could do more here and set the traffic split, etc., but don't for testing purposes.

Done in about 5 mins as soon as a commit is pushed!

Integrating to GAE (or anything) is really easy and simply requires a build step to "gcloud auth activate-service-account $circleciuser --key-file auth.json --project=$gproject" - Note the env. vars. which CircleCI holds in the project configuration; I base64 encode them but heavily restrict the service account's permissions in GAE; if you're really concerned about credentials and secrets, there are others things you could do to mitigate.

Enjoy the work from the CircleCI team in San Francisco.
