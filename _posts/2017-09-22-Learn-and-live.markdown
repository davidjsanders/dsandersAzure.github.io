I've said it before, but I'll say it again: If you're not exploring, you're not learning. If you're not learning, you're not living!

Modern computing techniques makes developing agile solutions so easy: Microservice architecture, Python for the code, Git and Git Hub for version control, Docker for containerization, Google App Engine for runtime, Circle CI for Continuous Integration (test in <1 min, GCloud install and deploy in 3 mins, Docker build and push in 2 mins!), and Redis Labs for caching. 

All for the costly sum of $0 per month (albeit running GAE standard and not using the containers).

If you're not exploring, you're not learning. If you're not learning, you're not living!
