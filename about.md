I'm a life-long learner. continual developer, and innovator with a track record of delivering strategic outcomes and realizing business value using collaborative, agile, and business driven approaches across retail, banking, engineering, and government sectors in consulting and pre-sales.

I aim to bridge gaps between business units and Information Technology by enabling clear paths to value and focusing IT discussions on how we optimize, innovate, and transform the business success.
